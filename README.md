This repository is to contain any processing needed related to multiple climate impacts in FRIDA.

Currently for FRIDAv2.1 it just collates the uncertainty parameter sets for the climate impacts which are
literature-derived with uncertainty.

The output pickle files need to be brought in from the repos which produce them for each impact separately:
https://github.com/chrisdwells/climate-energy-supply
https://github.com/chrisdwells/temperature-mortality
https://github.com/chrisdwells/extremes-exposure

The code here assumes these repos are kept in the same place as this one.
